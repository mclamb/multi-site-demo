Name: "ansible-linode-create"
Description: "Use Ansible Playbook to Create Linode Machine"
Documentation: |
  Runs one or more Ansible Playbook templates with the `ansible-apply` task.

  Requires an `ansible` context.

  Information can be chained together by having the playbook
  write `[Machine.Uuid].json` as a file.  This will be saved on the
  machine as `Param.ansible/output` and then fed into the next
  Playbook as the `digitalrebar` variable so it is available.

  Captures the IP address of the machine if the playbook writes
  the address into a `[Machine.Uuid]-address.txt` file.
