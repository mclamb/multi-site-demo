Name: "demo/cluster-prefix"
Description: "The cluster prefix used to identify the deployed cluster."
Documentation: |
  The cluster prefix is used to group the Multi Site Demo systems together.
  
  It is used by cloud providers to identify the cluster.  For example, the
  terraform pieces use this in Linode to set the tags = [ "tag1", "tag2" ]
  tags.  Other cloud providers should use this value too.

  The value is customized in the ``global`` profile of the global maanger,
  when the ``manager.sh`` script is run.

Schema:
  type: "string"
  default: "demo"
Meta:
  color: "blue"
  icon: "tags"
  title: "RackN Content"
